# Unity Lidgren Network FPS Demo
Work in progress. \
Networked FPS using the [Lidgren Network Library](https://github.com/lidgren/lidgren-network-gen3).

This is merely a demo I created to learn more about game networking & servers, as opposed to using Unity's built in networking solution.

Features
- Client Prediction
- Server Reconciliation

TODO
- Cleanup old movement code (pre client prediction)
